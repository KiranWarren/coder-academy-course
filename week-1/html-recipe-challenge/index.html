            <li>7 oranges</li>

            <li>Honey, where did I put my glasses?</li>
            <li>Oh, that's right, they're on my face, and,</li>
            <li>1 partridge in pear tree</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, follow my recipe exactly as follows, and you will be rewarded with the most delectable apple pie:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, put the kettle on for me, dear. I'm cold and could do with a cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Next, place the peeled apples into a saucepan and cook slowly with brown sugar until tender.</li>
            <li>Lastly, ensure that your seats are upright and all luggage has been stowed away in the overhead lockers or under the seat in front of you.</li>
